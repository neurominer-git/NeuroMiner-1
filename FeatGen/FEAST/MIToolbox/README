MIToolbox v1.03 for C/C++ and MATLAB/OCTAVE

The MIToolbox contains a set of functions to calculate information theoretic
quantities from data, such as the entropy and mutual information.  The toolbox
contains implementations of the most popular Shannon entropies, and also the
lesser known Renyi entropy.  The toolbox only supports discrete distributions,
as opposed to continuous. All real-valued numbers will be processed by x = floor(x)

These functions are targeted for use with feature selection algorithms rather 
than communication channels and so expect all the data to be available before 
execution and sample their own probability distributions from the data.

Things you can do:
 - Entropy
 - Conditional Entropy
 - Mutual Information
 - Conditional Mutual Information
 - generating a joint variable
 - generating a probability distribution from a discrete random variable
 - Renyi's Entropy
 - Renyi's Mutual Information

Note: all functions are calculated in log base 2, so return units of "bits".

Examples:

>> y = [1 1 1 0 0]';
>> x = [1 0 1 1 0]';

>> mi(x,y)       %% mutual information I(X;Y)
ans =
    0.0200

>> h(x)          %% entropy H(X)
ans =
    0.9710

>> condh(x,y)    %% conditional entropy H(X|Y)
ans =
    0.9510

>> h( [x,y] )    %% joint entropy H(X,Y)
ans =
    1.9219

>> joint([x,y])  %% joint random variable XY
ans =
     1
     2
     1
     3
     4

To compile the library for use in MATLAB/OCTAVE, execute CompileMIToolbox.m
from within MATLAB, or run 'make matlab' from a terminal.

To compile the library for C/C++, run 'make' at a terminal.

The C source files are licensed under the LGPL v3. The MATLAB wrappers and 
demonstration feature selection algorithms are provided as is with no warranty 
as examples of how to use the library in MATLAB.

Update History
08/11/2011 - v1.03 - Minor documentation changes to accompany the JMLR publication.
15/10/2010 - v1.02 - Fixed bug where MIToolbox would cause a segmentation fault if a x by 0 empty matrix was passed in. Now prints an error message and returns gracefully
02/09/2010 - v1.01 - Updated CMIM.m in demonstration_algorithms, due to a bug where the last feature would not be selected first if it had the highest MI
07/07/2010 - v1.00 - Initial Release
