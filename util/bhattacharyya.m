function d=bhattacharyya(X1,X2)
% BHATTACHARYYA  Bhattacharyya distance between two Gaussian classes
%
% d = bhattacharyya(X1,X2) returns the Bhattacharyya distance between X1 and X2.
%
% Inputs: X1 and X2 are n x m matrices represent two sets which have n
%         samples and m variables.
%
% Output: d is the Bhattacharyya distance between these two sets of data.
%
% Example:
%{
N=100;
M=10;
e1=2;
e2=5;
c1=3;
c2=7;
X1 = c1*randn(N,M)+e1;
X2 = c2*randn(N,M)+e2;
d = bhattacharyya(X1,X2);
