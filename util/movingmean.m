function result=movingmean(data,window,dim,option)
%Calculates the centered moving average of an n-dimensional matrix in any direction. 
%   result=movingmean(data,window,dim,option)

%   Inputs: 
%   1)  data = The matrix to be averaged. 
%   2)  window = The window size.  This works best as an odd number.  If an even 
%       number is entered then it is rounded down to the next odd number.  
%   3)  dim = The dimension in which you would like do the moving average.
%       This is an optional input.  To leave blank use [] place holder in
%       function call.  Defaults to 1.
%   4)  option = which solution algorithm to use.  The default option works
%       best in most situations, but option 2 works better for wide
%       matrices (i.e. 1000000 x 1 or 10 x 1000 x 1000) when solved in the
%       shorter dimension.  Data size where option 2 is more efficient will 
%       vary from computer to computre.This is an optional input.  To leave  
%       blank use [] place holder in function call.  Defaults to 1.
% 
%   Example:  
%   Calculate column moving average of 10000 x 10 matrix with a window size 
%   of 5 in the 1st dimension using algorithm option 1.
%   d=rand(10000,10);
%   dd=movingmean(d,5,1,1);
%           or
%   dd=movingmean(d,5,[],1);
%           or
%   dd=movingmean(d,5,1,[]);
%           or
%   dd=movingmean(d,5,1);
%           or
%   dd=movingmean(d,5,[],[]);
%           or
%   dd=movingmean(d,5);
%
%   Moving mean for each element uses data centered on that element and
%   incorporates (window-1)/2 elements before and after the element.
%
%   Function is broken into two parts.  The 1d-2d solution, and the
%   n-dimensional solution.  The 1d-2d solution is the fastest that I have 
%   been able to come up with, whereas the n-dimensional solution trades
%   speed for versatility.
%
%   Function includes some code at the end so that the user can do their
%   own speed testing using the TIMEIT function.
%
%   Has been heavily tested in 1d-2d case, and lightly tested in 3d case.
%   Should work in n-dimensional space, but has not been tested in more 
%   than 3 dimensions other than to make sure it does not return an error.
%   Has not been tested for complex inputs.
